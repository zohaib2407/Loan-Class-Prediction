# Loan-Class-Prediction
This is an academic project for predicting status of a loan.

In this analysis, we will analyze data from an online lending platform, Lending Club. The goal is to
develop models to predict which loans are at risk of default. Such models can then be used to devise
investment strategies.

## Background
P2P lending platforms - like Lending Club (LC), Prosper, Peerform, Upstart, etc - provide an online
environment for matching borrowers seeking loans and lenders looking to make an investment. With
lower operational costs than traditional lenders (banks), such online lending platforms leverage
technology, data and analytics to bring quicker and more convenient financing for individual and small
business borrowers from investors looking for attractive investment yields. With increasing volumes,
what started as peer-to-peer platforms for connecting individual borrowers and individual investors has
today evolved to include institutional investors, hedge funds, etc. Also called marketplace lending or
alternate lending, such fintech platforms have seen significant growth in recent years. It is estimated
that in 2018, 38% of all personal loans in the US were issued through fintech firms, growing from 5% in
2013 11. Some estimate the global online lending market to grow from ~$42B in 2018 to ~$460B in 2022
22. Lending Club, a pioneer in fintech, is one of the largest online lending platforms, with over $50B in
total loans issued till date.
LC issues personal loans between $1000 and $40,000 for 36 to 60 month durations. Interest rates on these loans
are determined based on a variety of information, including credit rating, credit history, income, etc.
Based on this, LC assigns a grade for each loan, ranging from A for safest loans to G for highest risk;
subgrades are also assigned within each grade. Loans are split into $25 notes, which investors can
purchase. Interested investors can browse different loans the LC website, which shows the assigned loan
grade and other information.
